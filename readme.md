# JavaScript Technical Assessment (18 November 2020)

This is the submission for a technical assessment I was invited to complete while applying for a software developer role. The objective of the assessment was to write a set of JavaScript functions in a given repository according to specifications. The written functions are then evaluated against unit tests using the [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) suite.

Assessment instructions were included in the original package as the `readme.md` file, which I cleaned up and included [here](./instructions.md) for public viewing.

The submission was originally made on 18 November 2020 and shared publicly on 30 October 2021. Since the assessment was delivered in an NPM package, I was able to release both a mirror of the original repository, and my final submission.

## Running

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute `npm install --production` to install the required packages.
3. Execute `npm run test` to perform the unit tests on the written functions.

The code for individual answers are found in the [answers](./answers/readme.md) folder.

I honestly *do not* care what you do with this. I am only uploading it here for archive purposes.
